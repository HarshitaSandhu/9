# 9 Sales Analysis 

First using SQL code we analayzed  on the 'dbo.ecommerce_data' table. It calculates the total sales amount for each product, total sales amount for each month and year, top-selling products by quantity, average sales amount per month, monthly sales trend, total sales amount for each customer, and sales performance comparison between different regions. The code is used to analyze sales data, calculate metrics, and provide insights into product performance, customer behavior, and regional sales performance.

Then on Power Bi , we made an interactive dashboard , various KPIs , tables and graphs were made to analyze the sales.
